### Overview

This is a full-stack web app inspired by the Yelpcamp project from The Web Developer Bootcamp course (by Colt Steele). Sign in to share ideas on fun things to do for kids and families. Working on this project taught me how to make RESTful routes, use a database, and build authentication & authorization.
