### Overview

This is a full-stack web app inspired by the Yelpcamp project from The Web Developer Bootcamp course (by Colt Steele). Sign in to share ideas on where to take the kids this weekend. Working on this project taught me how to make RESTful routes, use a database, and build authentication & authorization.
